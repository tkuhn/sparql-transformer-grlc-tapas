# Questionnaire on Consuming Linked Data Query Results

In this questionnaire, we would like to know your opinion about the usefulness of two systems, here called System A and System B, with respect to the presentation and representation of Linked Data query results.

Thanks for participating!

(* Required)


## Some quick questions about your background

Which of the following roles describes you best? *

- ( ) researcher
- ( ) developer
- ( ) other


What is your level of expertise with SPARQL? *

## Question 1 - Interface

Consider the following two interfaces showing in different ways the results of the same query about music bands (click on the links to see the screenshots):

System A: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/interface-1a.png

System B: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/interface-1b.png

As a (technically-minded) end user, would you prefer the interface of System A or System B in this particular case? *

- ( ) Strongly prefer A
- ( ) Slightly prefer A
- ( ) Indifferent
- ( ) Slightly prefer B
- ( ) Strongly prefer B


## Question 1 - JSON

The two systems represent the results in JSON in different ways. For the results above, these JSON representations look as follows (click the links to see the JSON representations):

System A: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/json-1a.txt

System B: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/json-1b.txt

As a developer, would you prefer System A or System B in this particular case, to process the JSON representations? *

- ( ) Strongly prefer A
- ( ) Slightly prefer A
- ( ) Indifferent
- ( ) Slightly prefer B
- ( ) Strongly prefer B


## Question 2 - Interface

Consider the same two interfaces again, but now with the results of a slightly more complex query about music bands:

System A: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/interface-2a.png

System B: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/interface-2b.png

As a (technically-minded) end user, would you prefer the interface of System A or System B in this particular case? *

- ( ) Strongly prefer A
- ( ) Slightly prefer A
- ( ) Indifferent
- ( ) Slightly prefer B
- ( ) Strongly prefer B


# Question 2 - JSON

Next, consider again the JSON representations for the results above:

System A: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/json-2a.txt

System B: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/json-2b.txt

As a developer, would you prefer System A or System B in this particular case, to process the JSON representations? *

- ( ) Strongly prefer A
- ( ) Slightly prefer A
- ( ) Indifferent
- ( ) Slightly prefer B
- ( ) Strongly prefer B


# Question 3 - Interface

Consider again the same two interfaces, but now showing the results of an even more complex query about music bands:

System A: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/interface-3a.png

System B: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/interface-3b.png

As a (technically-minded) end user, would you prefer the interface of System A or System B in this particular case? *

- ( ) Strongly prefer A
- ( ) Slightly prefer A
- ( ) Indifferent
- ( ) Slightly prefer B
- ( ) Strongly prefer B


# Question 3 - JSON

Lastly, consider the JSON representations of the results above:

System A: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/json-3a.txt

System B: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkuhn/stgt/master/eval/json-3b.txt

As a developer, would you prefer System A or System B in this particular case, to process the JSON representations? *

- ( ) Strongly prefer A
- ( ) Slightly prefer A
- ( ) Indifferent
- ( ) Slightly prefer B
- ( ) Strongly prefer B
